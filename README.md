### Problem 1:
Create a program that prints the user input until they enter 'q' to quit.

### Problem 2:
If the current number is evenly divisible by 3 you should print "FIZZ" and the number
If the current number is evenly divisible by 5 you should print "BUZZ" and the number
If the current number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5 you should print "FIZZBUZZ" and the number BOTH to the screen and to the file 'fizzbuzz.txt'
Otherwise, just print the number


### Problem 3:
Ask the user for a number. Add all of the numbers from 0 to the user input. Print the sum of all the numbers.

### Challenge:
Ask the user to enter a number. Ask the user to enter another number. Print from one number to the other number. Make sure it works regardless if the first or second number is greater than the other.
