### Problem 2:
Asks the user to enter 1 for 'count down', 2 for 'count up' and 'q' to quit. If they enter 1, ask them what number they want to count down to. Start from 0 and count down to that number by ones. If they enter 2, ask them what they want to count up to. Start from 0 and count up to the number by ones.

### Challenge:
