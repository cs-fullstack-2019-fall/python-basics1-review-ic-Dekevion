### Problem 1:
Create a program that will print from 1 to 100.
- If the current number is evenly divisible by 3 you should print "FIZZ" and the number
- If the current number is evenly divisible by 5 you should print "BUZZ" and the number
- If the current number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5 you should print "FIZZBUZZ"
- Otherwise, print the number

### Problem 2:
Create a program that takes the user input until they enter 'q'. You should store all of their input and separate the input with a comma. Once they enter 'q', print all of the comma separated words they entered.

### Challenge:
Ask the user to enter a number. Ask the user to enter another number. Print from one number to the other number. Make sure it works regardless if the first or second number is greater than the other.
